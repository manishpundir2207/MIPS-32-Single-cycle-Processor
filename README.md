A single cycle processor is a type of microprocessor architecture that executes one instruction per clock cycle. In
contrast to a multi-cycle processor, which takes several clock cycles to complete a single instruction, a single cycle
processor can complete an instruction in a single clock cycle. The MIPS 32 architecture is a popular 32-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture commonly
used in embedded systems, networking devices, and consumer electronics. It is known for its simplicity, efficiency,
and high performance.
